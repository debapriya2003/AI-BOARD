**An AI-Powered Interactive Whiteboard built with Next.js, Excalidraw, and Mistral AI**

## Overview

**AI-BOARD** is a simple yet powerful AI-assisted whiteboard application designed to merge visual thinking with conversational intelligence. It allows users to freely draw, sketch, and annotate ideas using an Excalidraw canvas while simultaneously interacting with an AI chatbot powered by **Mistral AI**.

The project focuses on enhancing brainstorming, teaching, planning, and problem-solving workflows by combining a familiar whiteboard interface with real-time AI assistance — all within a modern **Next.js** web application.

## How It Works

1. The Excalidraw canvas serves as the main workspace where users draw and visualize ideas.
2. The AI chatbot runs alongside the canvas, allowing users to interact with Mistral AI in real time.
3. Users can switch between drawing and chatting seamlessly, creating a hybrid workflow of **visual + textual intelligence**.

This setup makes AI-BOARD especially effective for concept explanation, step-by-step problem solving, and interactive learning.
